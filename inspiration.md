* Indian but modern
* Minimal but rich
* Smooth and cinematic
* Food should look like jewelry

User emotion when opening:
“This brand is premium. The food must be amazing.”

2. CORE VISUAL STYLE

---

Theme: Dark luxury

Background: Deep charcoal / near black

Rounded corners: medium to large
Cards should feel floating.
